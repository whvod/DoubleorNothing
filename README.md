# DoubleorNothing

# when running live server via vscode live server you can check that the contract imports solidity remix code

# To Do:
call playGame() solidity function

# when doing GuessingGame.playGame(function() {}) in html console, metamask notification comes up but has a transaction error from the contract because I need to send a msg.value of .01 ether but I only know how to do that via remix.ethereum.org
